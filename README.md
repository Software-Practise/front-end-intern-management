# Intern Management Application

The main aim of this project is to develop and design a functional prototype of an Internship Management Dashboard for Career Services at Northwest Missouri State University. The core functionality will be to maintain the records of the students who have applied for internships. As well as help students regarding the enrollment process - providing instruction manuals, and an application form which can be easily accessible by the students-on-students tab. Once done with the application, the administration will be notified and the student can check for the status of approval.
